Deliveries are kerbside only, although the drivers will usually attempt to place on the driveway if possible. We cannot deliver onto a slope. Flat gravel driveways would require sheets of plywood for the wheels of the manual pallet truck to roll on. Hiab deliveries may be possible in and around London, providing a crane offload onto most surfaces.<br\/><br\/>Please ensure someone is available to sign for the delivery, otherwise you will be liable for a £30 re-delivery charge per pack if the goods are unable to be left.<br\/><br\/>Whilst every effort is made for your delivery to arrive on the day specified, it is not possible to guarantee the delivery date as we use a third party pallet network for our deliveries. We advise allowing an additional day from the delivery date specified, even though their success rate is 98% on the day specified.<br\/><br\/>We offer standard 3-5 working day delivery and express 1-2 day delivery for £12 on checkout.<br\/><br\/>Standard delivery is included on most orders within mainland England, Wales and Scotland. There is an additional charge of £40 per pack for the following Postcodes: AB, DD, FK (8-9, 11-21), IV, KW, KY (6+), PA, PH, TR<br\/><\/p><p>Whilst our carriers will always make every effort to deliver the products on the agreed delivery date we can not be held responsible for matters beyond our control that results in your products not arriving on the day in question.
